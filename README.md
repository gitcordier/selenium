So, it's all about the Paris Fintech Forum (https://www.parisfintechforum.com)!
To me more specific, the script gets all "featured" participants websites 
(Source: https://www.parisfintechforum.com/PFF2018/participants).

Requirements:

1. Python 3
    Code runs perfectly well with Python 3.7.
    
1. A web browser. 
    The code aims at Firefox, but it's pretty sure it works with other mainstream browsers e.g. Chrome, Opera, Safari. 
    Simply write/comment/uncomment the relevant lines below line 12

2. You may need to install selenium-server-standalone-3.14X.Y.jar (ensure that a Java 8 SRE in already installed) from the selenium website (https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and export its location to your PATH before your Selenium's pip install (e.g. 'pip3 install selenium').
